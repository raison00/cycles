# cycles
cycles was created and distributed to public health youth outreach programs, county health departments, and other services focusing on at-risk youth.  Its intention was to package history, facts, health education, and resources for young adults who have not had access to a comprehensive, factual health education. In many states in America, it is mandated health classes not teach factual health information and human biology if they are to accept federal funding.  It is also easy to find current, contemporary lawmakers spreading inaccurate and dangerously ignorant concepts on anatomy and biology.  Denying factual information to our citizens has lead to consequences that can impact generations to come. This project counters those policies with factual resources with a fun, stylistic design.

This project predicted the continuous dismantling of equal access to health services, emphasised the continuous fight for equality and warned of the dangers of legislating away all progress made in the past 40 years, much of which is the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsberg.

## women's history quiz

I wrote all the content, drew all the illustrations, designed the UI and UX, researched and wrote all the code and content, amassing a large collection of books on women's history in the process. The quiz is a small piece of the cycles project.  The quiz is to be taken after consuming the project's comprehensive overview of women's history and how legislation and incidents have shaped women's access to healthcare. 

Zapfino and Copperpot fonts were used.  My appologies.
