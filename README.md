# cycles
cycles was created and distributed to public health youth outreach programs, county health departments, and other services focusing on at-risk youth.  Its intention was to package history, facts, health education, and resources for young adults who have not had access to a comprehensive, factual health education. In many states in America, it is mandated health classes not teach factual health information and human biology.  It is also easy to find current, contemporary lawmakers spreading inaccurate and dangerously ignorant concepts on anatomy and biology.  

This project predicted the continuous dismantling of equal access to health services, emphasised the continuous fight for equality and warned of the dangers of legislating away all progress made in the past 40 years, much of which is the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsberg.

## women's history quiz

Created in 2002 to teach myself coding and to understand / counteract the ongoing fight for equal access to healthcare by understanding the layered history of progress made and the continuous desire to control women's autonomy and negate equality.  I wrote all the content, drew all the illustrations, designed the UI and UX, wrote all the code and content, amassing a large collection of books in the process. The quiz is a small piece of the cycles project.  The quiz is to be taken after consuming the project's comprehensive overview of women's history and how legislation and incidents have shaped women's access to healthcare. 

Zapfino and Copperpot fonts were used.  My appologies.
